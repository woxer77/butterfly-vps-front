        <p>A plotter machine is a type of printer used primarily for printing vector graphics. Unlike regular printers
          that print using a series of dots, plotters draw continuous lines, making them ideal for high-precision tasks
          such as engineering drawings, architectural plans, and detailed maps.</p><br/>
        <p>There are different types of plotters:</p><br/>
        <p><strong>1. Pen Plotters:</strong> These use actual pens to draw on paper, moving along the X and Y axes to
          create continuous lines. They are highly accurate and can produce large-scale designs with fine detail.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Cutting Plotters:</strong> Instead of drawing with a pen, these plotters use a blade to cut shapes
          out of materials such as vinyl, paper, or fabric. They are commonly used in the signage and garment industries
          to create stickers, decals, and patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Electrostatic Plotters:</strong> These use a dry toner transfer process similar to photocopiers.
          They are faster than pen plotters and can handle larger formats, but the quality of the images is often lower
          than pen plotters.</p>

        <p>A CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine is a sophisticated piece of equipment used in manufacturing that
          operates through computer programming to automate the control of machining tools. These machines can perform a
          wide variety of tasks such as cutting, drilling, milling, and turning on materials like metal, plastic, wood,
          foam, and composites.</p><br/><br/>

        <p><strong>1. Software:</strong> CNC machining begins with a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) model, which is
          converted to a CNC program using CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software. This program contains the
          instructions (G-code) for the machine to follow.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Machining Process:</strong> Once the program is loaded, the CNC machine follows the coded
          instructions to move and control the tools, cutting and shaping the material to precise specifications.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Types of Machines:</strong></p>
        <li>CNC Mills: Use rotating cutting tools to remove material from a stationary workpiece.</li>
        <li>CNC Lathes: Rotate the workpiece against a stationary cutting tool, ideal for producing symmetrical parts.
        </li>
        <li>CNC Routers: Similar to mills but used primarily for cutting softer materials like wood.</li>
        <li>Water Jet Cutters: Use high-pressure water, sometimes mixed with abrasives, to cut tough materials without
          heat.
        </li>
        <li>EDM Machines: Use electrical discharges to cut and shape materials, often used for hard metals.</li>
        <li>CNC Drilling Machines: Specialize in creating precise holes in materials.</li>
